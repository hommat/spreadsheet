## General info

It is my second project in React. I wanted to create something like Google Docs spreadsheets. I did not complete this project, but I still learned a lot about cooperation between frontend and backend via API. I also started to care more about optimalization.

## Technologies
Frontend:

* React
* Redux
* Sass

Backend:

* Express
* MongoDB

## Features
Sheet:

* Resizing
* Cut, Copy, Paste
* Undo, Redo
* Aligment 
* Background and font color
* Bold, italic, underline text

Auth:
* Login system
* Account sheets storage

## Status
Project is  _no longer continue_, because at the time of creation I had no idea how could I improve very bad big sheet performance, so I focused on other projects.

## Inspiration
Project inspired by [Google Sheets](https://www.google.pl/intl/pl/sheets/about/).
Backend integration based on [Traversy Media MERN Stack tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBTYxXADG_k&list=PLillGF-RfqbbiTGgA77tGO426V3hRF9iE).
